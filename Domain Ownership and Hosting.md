# 🌐 Domain Ownership + Hosting — Emoji Cheat Sheet

## 🔒 While You Own It

Once you register **`nakodtech.com`**, it’s **exclusively yours** for the paid term (e.g., 1 year).
No one else can register or “use” that name. ✅

### .com 👔
- Default “business/commercial” signal worldwide
- Easiest for people to remember/type
- Best first choice for a company site and email (e.g., info@nakodtech.com
)

### .org 🤝
- Traditionally nonprofits, NGOs, communities, open-source
- Today anyone can buy it, but it still implies mission/nonprofit to many people
- Good for a foundation, docs/community site, or CSR arm


### .xyz — $1–2 first year
The XYZ registry runs aggressive promos (loss-leader). Renewals are usually much higher (often ~$10–$15+). It’s cheap because the registry wants adoption.

### .it.com — $3–4 first year (renews ~$25+)
This isn’t the country .it or classic .com. It’s a third-level name sold under it.com (like buying nakodtech.it.com). Lower trust/recognition → cheaper intro price; renewals are higher.


## ⏳ If You Let It Expire — What Happens?

1. **Grace Period** (≈ 0–45 days) 🟡
   You can renew at **normal price**; site/email may be parked.
2. **Redemption Period** (≈ 30 days) 🔴
   You can still restore it, but pay a **redemption fee + renewal**.
3. **Pending Delete** (≈ 5 days) ⚫
   Cannot recover.
4. **Drops** 💥
   Domain becomes available again—**anyone** (or an auction/backorder winner) can register it.

## 🛡️ Tips So No One Else Gets It

* ✅ Turn **Auto‑Renew** on and add a **backup card**.
* ✅ Keep your **contact email** current (renewal notices).
* ✅ Enable **Domain Lock** (blocks unauthorized transfers).
* ✅ Set calendar reminders **30 / 7 days** before expiry.

> **Bottom line:** Buy it → only **you** control it.
> Let it fully lapse → **someone else can take it**.
