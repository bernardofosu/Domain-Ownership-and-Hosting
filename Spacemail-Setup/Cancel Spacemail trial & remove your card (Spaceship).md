## 1) 🚫 Turn OFF auto‑renew / cancel the Spacemail trial

1. Go to **Spaceship → Spacemail Manager** (left nav or “All products”).
2. Make sure you’re on the Spacemail for **nakodtech.xyz**.
3. (Optional but tidy) Next to your mailbox **[info@nakodtech.xyz](mailto:info@nakodtech.xyz)**, click the **⋯ menu → Delete** → confirm. 🗑️
4. Back on the Spacemail header, click **Manage** (top‑right).

   * If you see **Disable auto‑renew / Cancel plan / Delete Spacemail**, choose it.
   * Confirm the prompts (you may need to type **DELETE**).
5. Verify the status now shows **Canceled/Auto‑renew: Off**.

> ✅ Result: The Spacemail product won’t renew when the trial ends.

## 2) 💳 Remove your payment card

1. Click your **avatar (top‑right)** → **Payment Methods**.
2. Find the card → click **⋯ / Remove / Trash** → **Remove** to confirm.
3. If “Remove” is greyed out, first **turn off auto‑renew** on *every* product, then try again.
4. Still stuck? Open **Ask Alf / Support** and ask to **purge all saved payment methods** from your account.

> ✅ Result: No card on file = no charges.

## 3) 🔍 Double‑check you’re safe

* **All products**: Spacemail should show **Canceled/Expired** (or be gone).
* **Spacemail Manager**: shows **No mailboxes** and no active plan.
* **Billing/Invoices**: nothing upcoming; last invoice is \$0 during trial.

## 4) 🧳 (Optional) Export any mail before deleting

If you want to keep messages:

* In **Thunderbird**: File → **Export** → **Mailbox** (or right‑click folder → **Export**).
* Or connect via **IMAP** (mail.spacemail.com, SSL, 993) and copy mail to a local folder before deletion.

---

## 5) 🔐 What if I only want to keep the domain?

No problem! These steps only cancel **Spacemail**. Your domain **nakodtech.xyz** stays active. You can keep its DNS, GitHub Pages CNAMEs, etc.

---

## 6) 🧭 Quick recap

* **Delete mailbox** (optional tidy) → **Disable auto‑renew/Cancel plan** under **Manage**.
* **Remove card** under **Payment Methods**.
* **Verify** there’s no upcoming charge.

🎉 You’re done—no renewal, no card on file.
